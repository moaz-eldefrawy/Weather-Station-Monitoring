- Each weather station outputs a status message every 1 second to report its weather status to Kafka.
- The Central Station consumes these weahter status messages does the following:

  - check fo humidity and notify if went above certain level
  - Batch archive data in parquet files
  - Write data to the bitcask lsm

- Then a connector fetches the parquet data into ES to be analyzed by kibana and report battry status like the following
